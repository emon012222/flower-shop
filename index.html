                    <p>
                    <h3>Detail:</h3>The story of the red spider lily begins with a beautiful autumnal scene in late
                    September during the Buddhist holiday of Ohigan. It’s this period of time just before the autumn
                    equinox, that has given rise to one of the most fascinating folklores of any flower in the world. In
                    Japan, Ohigan is a time to return home to visit graves and pay respects to ancestors. It also
                    happens to coincide with the brief flowering time of the red spider lily (Lycoris radiata), which
                    unusually blooms in the autumn. Because of the flower’s association with Ohigan (お彼岸) and the
                    autumnal equinox (彼岸), it’s known in Japanese as Higanbana (彼岸花).

                    Spider Lily by Kawarazaki Shodo
                    The flower’s autumnal bloom is not the only unusual thing about its appearance. This lily blooms
                    well before the leaves come out. A cluster of bright red, spidery flowers with long stamens blaze
                    atop a slender green stalk, creating a red wash over the landscape. The red glow quickly fades as
                    the petals shrivel up, leaving the plant bare. The leaves then emerge, bringing life back to the
                    plant once more before they too turn brown and the plant returns to the soil, dying a second time.
